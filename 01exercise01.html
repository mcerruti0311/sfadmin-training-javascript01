    <li>In the “Try It Yourself” section of this hour, we used the line
       alert(document.title); to output the title property of the document
       object. Try rewriting that script to instead output the
       document.lastModified property, which contains the date and
      time that the web page was last changed. (Be careful—property names are
      case sensitive. Note the capital M.) See whether you can then modify the
      code to use document.write() in place of alert() to write the property
      directly into the page, as in
      Figure 1.3.
      <li>Try the example code from this hour in as many different browsers as
        you have access to. What differences do you note in how the example
        pages are displayed?
