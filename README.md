## Exercises

* In the “Try It Yourself” section of this hour, we used the line
alert(document.title);
to output the title property of the document object. Try rewriting that script to instead output the document.lastModified property, which
contains the date and time that the web page was last changed. (Be careful—property names are case sensitive. Note the capital M.) See
whether you can then modify the code to use document.write() in place of alert() to write the property directly into the page, as in
Figure 1.3.
* Try the example code from this hour in as many different browsers as you have access to. What differences do you note in how the example
pages are displayed?
